\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Proof Of Concept Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The GCP accuracy is much better than the accuracy of the resultant surface... gcp accuracy is not necessarily indicative of pointcloud accuracy
	\item the accuracy in this experiment is closely coupled to the texture of the scene
	\item Cube has rounded edges in dense pointcloud
	\item Accuracy in shadows?
	\item Accuracy outside GCPs?
	\item Sparse accuracy as a function of number of images, reprojection error, etc
	\item Here I just want to give a taste of some preliminary results from this simple experiment to really spell out capabilities
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methodology Discussion and Implications}
\begin{itemize}
	\item methodology allows for robust experimentation and testing of numerous independent variables
	\item radiometric accuracy is not currently accounted for, as SfM only cares about texture... could incorporate later
\end{itemize}
