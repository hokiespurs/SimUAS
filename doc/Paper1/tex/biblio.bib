abstract = {This paper describes a novel system for accurate 3D digitization of complex objects. Its main novelties can be seen in the new approach, which brings together different systems and tools in a unique platform capable of automatically generating an accurate and complete model for an object of interest. This is performed through generating an approximate model of the object, designing a stereo imaging network for the object with this model and capturing the images at the designed postures through exploiting an inverse kinematics method for a non-standard six degree of freedom robot. The images are then used for accurate and dense 3D reconstruction using photogrammetric multi-view stereo method in two modes, including resolving scale with baseline and with control points. The results confirm the feasibility of using Particle Swarm Optimization in solving inverse kinematics for this non-standard robot. The system provides this opportunity to test the effect of incidence angle on imaging network design and shows that the matching algorithms work effectively for incidence angle of 10??. The accuracy of the final point cloud generated with the system was tested in two modes through a comparison with a dataset generated with a close range 3D colour laser scanner. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Brodu2012,
abstract = {3D point clouds of natural environments relevant to problems in geomorphology (rivers, coastal environments, cliffs,. ...) often require classification of the data into elementary relevant classes. A typical example is the separation of riparian vegetation from ground in fluvial environments, the distinction between fresh surfaces and rockfall in cliff environments, or more generally the classification of surfaces according to their morphology (e.g. the presence of bedforms or by grain size). Natural surfaces are heterogeneous and their distinctive properties are seldom defined at a unique scale, prompting the use of multi-scale criteria to achieve a high degree of classification success. We have thus defined a multi-scale measure of the point cloud dimensionality around each point. The dimensionality characterizes the local 3D organization of the point cloud within spheres centered on the measured points and varies from being 1D (points set along a line), 2D (points forming a plane) to the full 3D volume. By varying the diameter of the sphere, we can thus monitor how the local cloud geometry behaves across scales. We present the technique and illustrate its efficiency in separating riparian vegetation from ground and classifying a mountain stream as vegetation, rock, gravel or water surface. In these two cases, separating the vegetation from ground or other classes achieve accuracy larger than 98{\%}. Comparison with a single scale approach shows the superiority of the multi-scale analysis in enhancing class separability and spatial resolution of the classification. Scenes between 10 and one hundred million points can be classified on a common laptop in a reasonable time. The technique is robust to missing data, shadow zones and changes in point density within the scene. The classification is fast and accurate and can account for some degree of intra-class morphological variability such as different vegetation types. A probabilistic confidence in the classification result is given at each point, allowing the user to remove the points for which the classification is uncertain. The process can be both fully automated (minimal user input once, all scenes treated in large computation batches), but also fully customized by the user including a graphical definition of the classifiers if so desired. Working classifiers can be exchanged between users independently of the instrument used to acquire the data avoiding the need to go through full training of the classifier. Although developed for fully 3D data, the method can be readily applied to 2.5D airborne lidar data. ?? 2012 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).},

abstract = {Combination of UAV-based aerial pictures and Structure-from-Motion (SfM) algorithm provides an efficient, low-cost and rapid framework for remote sensing and monitoring of dynamic natural environments. This methodology is particularly suitable for repeated topographic surveys in remote or poorly accessible areas. However, temporal analysis of landform topography requires high accuracy of measurements and reproducibility of the methodology as differencing of digital surface models leads to error propagation. In order to assess the repeatability of the SfM technique, we surveyed a study area characterized by gentle topography with an UAV platform equipped with a standard reflex camera, and varied the focal length of the camera and location of georeferencing targets between flights. Comparison of different SfM-derived topography datasets shows that precision of measurements is in the order of centimetres for identical replications which highlights the excellent performance of the SfM workflow, all parameters being equal. The precision is one order of magnitude higher for 3D topographic reconstructions involving independent sets of ground control points, which results from the fact that the accuracy of the localisation of ground control points strongly propagates into final results.},

UAS, Remotely-Piloted Aerial Systems, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or simply, drones are a hot topic comprising a diverse array of aspects including technology, privacy rights, safety and regulations, and even war and peace. Modern photogrammetry and remote sensing identified the potential of UAS-sourced imagery more than thirty years ago. In the last five years, these two sister disciplines have developed technology and methods that challenge the current aeronautical regulatory framework and their own traditional acquisition and processing methods. Navety and ingenuity have combined off-the-shelf, low-cost equipment with sophisticated computer vision, robotics and geomatic engineering. The results are cm-level resolution and accuracy products that can be generated even with cameras costing a few-hundred euros. In this review article, following a brief historic background and regulatory status analysis, we review the recent unmanned aircraft, sensing, navigation, orientation and general data processing developments for UAS photogrammetry and remote sensing with emphasis on the nano-micro-mini UAS segment. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {Shadow often interferes with accurate image analysis. To mitigate shadow effects in near-earth imagery (2 m above ground level), we created high dynamic range (HDR) nadir images and used them to measure grassland ground cover. HDR composites were created by merging three differentially exposed images spanning a wide exposure range and resulted in lightened shadows. HDR images showed more detail; reduced the numbers of pure black, pure white, and pixels visually indistinguishable from black and white; reapportioned skewed luma values towards a normal distribution; and increased the Euclidean distance between litter and bare ground RGB values--allowing increased feature separation; all of which facilitated an increase in real feature classification through manual image analysis. Drawbacks to the method included decreased image sharpness due to minor misalignment of images or moving vegetation, time required to create HDR images, and difficulty with acquiring primary images from a moving platform. We conclude that HDR imagery can provide more accurate measurements of bare soil cover for ecosystem monitoring and assessment.},

abstract = {Ecological remote sensing is being transformed by three-dimensional (3D), multispectral measurements of forest canopies by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and computer vision structure from motion (SFM) algorithms. Yet applications of this technology have out-paced understanding of the relationship between collection method and data quality. Here, UAV-SFM remote sensing was used to produce 3D multispectral point clouds of Temperate Deciduous forests at different levels of UAV altitude, image overlap, weather, and image processing. Error in canopy height estimates was explained by the alignment of the canopy height model to the digital terrain model (R2 = 0.81) due to differences in lighting and image overlap. Accounting for this, no significant differences were observed in height error at different levels of lighting, altitude, and side overlap. Overall, accurate estimates of canopy height compared to field measurements (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 3.6 m) and LIDAR (R2 = 0.99, RMSE = 3.0 m) were obtained under optimal conditions of clear lighting and high image overlap ({\textgreater}80{\%}). Variation in point cloud quality appeared related to the behavior of SFM ‘image features'. Future research should consider the role of image features as the fundamental unit of SFM remote sensing, akin to the pixel of optical imaging and the laser pulse of LIDAR.},

The area of interest is a LIP (Late Intermediate Period; 1400 AD) settlement, situated 400 km in the south of the capital of Peru (Lima) close by the famous Geoglyphs of Nasca. The site was recorded using a terrestrial laser scanner (Riegl LMS-Z420i) and a mini UAV-system (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) under the framework of a research program called NTG (“New methods and technologies in the humanities”). During the field work, using both methods, the complete settlement was documented in a short time. The post-processing of the data was done by use of in-house developed software packages. The image data (UAV) were oriented and a DSM (10 cm resolution) was generated automatically using a multi-image matching approach. For the registration of the single laser scans a surface matcher rather than the special targets was used. As a product of the laser data a regular raster grid with point spacing of 5 cm was generated. The 3D comparison of both elevation models shows a mean value less than 1 cm with a standard deviation of 6 cm. The main discrepancy between the data sets results mostly from occlusion, caused on the restricted viewing directions of the acquisition stand points. The presented data acquisition and processing methods showed their high usability for the documentation of archaeological sites.},

This overlapping clustering problem is formulated as a constrained optimization and solved iteratively. The merging algorithm, designed to be parallel and out-of-core, incorporates robust filtering steps to eliminate low-quality reconstructions and enforce global visibility constraints. The approach has been tested on several large datasets downloaded from Flickr.com, including one with over ten thousand images, yielding a 3D reconstruction with nearly thirty million points.},

abstract = {As a core robotic and vision problem, camera and range sensor calibration have been researched intensely over the last decades. However, robotic research efforts still often get heavily delayed by the requirement of setting up a calibrated system consisting of multiple cameras and range measurement units. With regard to removing this burden, we present a toolbox with web interface for fully automatic camera- to-camera and camera-to-range calibration. Our system is easy to setup and recovers intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters as well as the transformation between cameras and range sensors within one minute. In contrast to existing calibration approaches, which often require user intervention, the proposed method is robust to varying imaging conditions, fully automatic, and easy to use since a single image and range scan proves sufficient for most calibration scenarios. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed checkerboard corner detector significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the proposed camera-to-range registration method is able to discover multiple solutions in the case of ambiguities. Experi- ments using a variety of sensors such as grayscale and color cameras, the Kinect 3D sensor and the Velodyne HDL-64 laser scanner show the robustness of our method in different indoor and outdoor settings and under various lighting conditions.

We intend to use laser scanning to detect changes on building sites or inside facilities, mainly for monitoring purposes but also to be able to provide synthetic information in case of an emergency. In both cases, the main constraint is time. A minimum precision on the measure of movements is also required, depending on the type of application. Laser scanner seems to be the perfect tool for such applications as it quickly acquires a large amount of accurate 3D data. But the comparison of so huge datasets implies the use of appropriate structures and ad-hoc algorithms. A specific octree structure is described, and then several simple cloud-to-cloud comparison techniques are presented. The best one, based on the Hausdorff distance computation is improved on various points. Also, as a full automatic process seems still unachievable, a software framework has been developed. It intends to minimize human intervention and therefore prevents from wasting the LiDAR speed in time-consuming post-processing operations.},

abstract = {In this paper, two methods based on computer vision are presented in order to produce dense point clouds and high resolution DEMs (digital elevation models) of the Corral del Veleta rock glacier in Sierra Nevada (Spain). The first one is a semi-automatic 3D photo-reconstruction method (SA-3D-PR) based on the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform algorithm and the epipolar geometry theory that uses oblique photographs and camera calibration parameters as input. The second method is fully automatic (FA-3D-PR) and is based on the recently released software 123D-Catch that uses the Structure from Motion and MultiView Stereo algorithms and needs as input oblique photographs and some measurements in order to scale and geo-reference the resulting model. The accuracy of the models was tested using as benchmark a 3D model registered by means of a Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS). The results indicate that both methods can be applied to micro-scale study of rock glacier morphologies and processes with average distances to the TLS point cloud of 0.28 m and 0.21 m, for the SA-3D-PR and the FA-3D-PR methods, respectively. The performance of the models was also tested by means of the dimensionless relative precision ratio parameter resulting in figures of 1:1071 and 1:1429 for the SA-3D-PR and the FA-3D-PR methods, respectively. Finally, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the study area were produced and compared with the TLS-derived DEM.

abstract = {Sensor miniaturisation, improved battery technology and the availability of low-cost yet advanced Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have provided new opportunities for environmental remote sensing. The UAV provides a platform for close-range aerial photography. Detailed imagery captured from micro-UAV can produce dense point clouds using multi-view stereopsis (MVS) techniques combining photogrammetry and computer vision. This study applies MVS techniques to imagery acquired from a multi-rotor micro-UAV of a natural coastal site in southeastern Tasmania, Australia. A very dense point cloud ( {\textless} 1–3 cm point spacing) is produced in an arbitrary coordinate system using full resolution imagery, whereas other studies usually downsample the original imagery. The point cloud is sparse in areas of complex vegetation and where surfaces have a homogeneous texture. Ground control points collected with Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) are identified and used for georeferencing via a Helmert transformation. This study compared georeferenced point clouds to a Total Station survey in order to assess and quantify their geometric accuracy. The results indicate that a georeferenced point cloud accurate to 25–40 mm can be obtained from imagery acquired from 50 m. UAV-based image capture provides the spatial and temporal resolution required to map and monitor natural landscapes. This paper assesses the accuracy of the generated point clouds based on field survey points. Based on our key findings we conclude that sub-decimetre terrain change (in this case coastal erosion) can be monitored.},

abstract = {In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetric surveys, the cameracan be pre-calibrated or can be calibrated "on-the-job" using structure-from-motion anda self-calibrating bundle adjustment. This study investigates the impact on mapping accuracyof UAV photogrammetric survey blocks, the bundle adjustment and the 3D reconstructionprocess under a range of typical operating scenarios for centimetre-scale natural landformmapping (in this case, a coastal cliff). We demonstrate the sensitivity of the process tocalibration procedures and the need for careful accuracy assessment. For this investigation, vertical (nadir or near-nadir) and oblique photography were collected with 80{\%}–90{\%}overlap and with accurately-surveyed ($\sigma$ ≤ 2 mm) and densely-distributed ground control.This allowed various scenarios to be tested and the impact on mapping accuracy to beassessed. This paper presents the results of that investigation and provides guidelines thatwill assist with operational decisions regarding camera calibration and ground control forUAV photogrammetry. The results indicate that the use of either a robust pre-calibration ora robust self-calibration results in accurate model creation from vertical-only photography,and additional oblique photography may improve the results. The results indicate thatif a dense array of high accuracy ground control points are deployed and the UAVphotography includes both vertical and oblique images, then either a pre-calibration or anon-the-job self-calibration will yield reliable models (pre-calibration RMSEXY = 7.1 mmand on-the-job self-calibration RMSEXY = 3.2 mm). When oblique photography was Remote Sens. 2015, 7 11934 excluded from the on-the-job self-calibration solution, the accuracy of the model deteriorated(by 3.3 mm horizontally and 4.7 mm vertically). When the accuracy of the ground controlwas then degraded to replicate typical operational practice ($\sigma$ = 22 mm), the accuracyof the model further deteriorated (e.g., on-the-job self-calibration RMSEXY went from3.2–7.0 mm). Additionally, when the density of the ground control was reduced, the modelaccuracy also further deteriorated (e.g., on-the-job self-calibration RMSEXY went from7.0–7.3 mm). However, our results do indicate that loss of accuracy due to sparse groundcontrol can be mitigated by including oblique imagery.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of obtaining complete, detailed reconstructions of textureless shiny objects. We present an algorithm which uses silhouettes of the object, as well as images obtained under changing illumination conditions. In contrast with previous photometric stereo techniques, ours is not limited to a single viewpoint but produces accurate reconstructions in full 3D. A number of images of the object are obtained from multiple viewpoints, under varying lighting conditions. Starting from the silhouettes, the algorithm recovers camera motion and constructs the object's visual hull. This is then used to recover the illumination and initialize a multiview photometric stereo scheme to obtain a closed surface reconstruction. There are two main contributions in this paper: First, we describe a robust technique to estimate light directions and intensities and, second, we introduce a novel formulation of photometric stereo which combines multiple viewpoints and, hence, allows closed surface reconstructions. The algorithm has been implemented as a practical model acquisition system. Here, a quantitative evaluation of the algorithm on synthetic data is presented together with complete reconstructions of challenging real objects. Finally, we show experimentally how, even in the case of highly textured objects, this technique can greatly improve on correspondence-based multiview stereo results.},

However, the accuracy of photogrammetrically derived digital terrain models (DTMs) from UAV imagery is not extensively tested. This gap is addressed through a case study of stockpile volume estimation. A gravel stockpile was surveyed with a vertical take-off and landing UAV before and after a portion of it was excavated. Softcopy photogrammetry was applied to the UAV images to produce before and after DTMs, each with a resolution of 3.5 cm. The vertical accuracy of the UAV DTMs was estimated with global positioning system (GPS) test points, yielding RMS errors of 0.106 (before) and 0.097 m (after). These errors are similar to, if not lower, than those produced by airborne light detection and ranging (LIDAR), in general, but are higher than for terrestrial laser scanning.

abstract = {Small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) are a relatively new type of aerial platform for acquiring high-resolution remote sensing measurements of Earth surface processes and landforms. However, despite growing application there has been little quantitative assessment of sUAS performance. Here we present results from a field experiment designed to evaluate the accuracy of a photogrammetrically-derived digital terrain model (DTM) developed from imagery acquired with a low-cost digital camera onboard an sUAS. We also show the utility of the high-resolution (0.1m) sUAS imagery for resolving small-scale biogeomorphic features. The experiment was conducted in an area with active and stabilized aeolian landforms in the southern Canadian Prairies. Images were acquired with a Hawkeye RQ-84Z Areohawk fixed-wing sUAS. A total of 280 images were acquired along 14 flight lines, covering an area of 1.95km2. The survey was completed in 4.5h, including GPS surveying, sUAS setup and flight time. Standard image processing and photogrammetric techniques were used to produce a 1m resolution DTM and a 0.1m resolution orthorectified image mosaic. The latter revealed previously un-mapped bioturbation features. The vertical accuracy of the DTM was evaluated with 99 Real-Time Kinematic GPS points, while 20 of these points were used to quantify horizontal accuracy. The horizontal root mean squared error (RMSE) of the orthoimage was 0.18m, while the vertical RMSE of the DTM was 0.29m, which is equivalent to the RMSE of a bare earth LiDAR DTM for the same site. The combined error from both datasets was used to define a threshold of the minimum elevation difference that could be reliably attributed to erosion or deposition in the seven years separating the sUAS and LiDAR datasets. Overall, our results suggest that sUAS-acquired imagery may provide a low-cost, rapid, and flexible alternative to airborne LiDAR for geomorphological mapping. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Topographic measurements for detailed studies of processes such as erosion or mass movement are usually acquired by expensive laser scanners or rigorous photogrammetry. Here, we test and use an alternative technique based on freely available computer vision software which allows general geoscientists to easily create accurate 3D models from field photographs taken with a consumer-grade camera. The approach integrates structure-from-motion (SfM) and multiview-stereo (MVS) algorithms and, in contrast to traditional photogrammetry techniques, it requires little expertise and few control measurements, and processing is automated. To assess the precision of the results, we compare SfM-MVS models spanning spatial scales of centimeters (a hand sample) to kilometers (the summit craters of Piton de la Fournaise volcano) with data acquired from laser scanning and formal close-range photogrammetry. The relative precision ratio achieved by SfM-MVS (measurement precision: observation distance) is limited by the straightforward camera calibration model used in the software, but generally exceeds 1:1000 (i.e., centimeter-level precision over measurement distances of 10 s of meters). We apply SfM-MVS at an intermediate scale, to determine erosion rates along a similar to 50-m-long coastal cliff. Seven surveys carried out over a year indicate an average retreat rate of 0.70 +/- 0.05 m a(-1). Sequential erosion maps (at similar to 0.05 m grid resolution) highlight the spatiotemporal variability in the retreat, with semivariogram analysis indicating a correlation between volume loss and length scale. Compared with a laser scanner survey of the same site, SfM-MVS produced comparable data and reduced data collection time by similar to 80{\%}.},

abstract = {High resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) are increasingly produced from photographs acquired with consumer cameras, both from the ground and from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, although such DEMs may achieve centimetric detail, they can also display systematic broad-scale error that restricts their wider use. Such errors which, in typical UAV data are expressed as a vertical ‘doming' of the surface, result from a combination of near-parallel imaging directions and inaccurate correction of radial lens distortion. Using simulations of multi-image networks with near-parallel viewing directions, we show that enabling camera self-calibration as part of the bundle adjustment process inherently leads to erroneous radial distortion estimates and associated DEM error. This effect is relevant whether a traditional photogrammetric or newer structure-from-motion (SfM) approach is used, but errors are expected to be more pronounced in SfM-based DEMs, for which use of control and check point measurements are typically more limited. Systematic DEM error can be significantly reduced by the additional capture and inclusion of oblique images in the image network; we provide practical flight plan solutions for fixed wing or rotor-based UAVs that, in the absence of control points, can reduce DEM error by up to two orders of magnitude. The magnitude of doming error shows a linear relationship with radial distortion and we show how characterization of this relationship allows an improved distortion estimate and, hence, existing datasets to be optimally reprocessed. Although focussed on UAV surveying, our results are also relevant to ground-based image capture. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Recent advances in computer vision and image analysis have led to the development of a novel, fully automated photogrammetric method to generate dense 3d point cloud data. This approach, termed Structure-from-Motion or SfM, requires only limited ground-control and is ideally suited to imagery obtained from low-cost, non-metric cameras acquired either at close-range or using aerial platforms. Terrain models generated using SfM have begun to emerge recently and with a growing spectrum of software now available, there is an urgent need to provide a robust quality assessment of the data products generated using standard field and computational workflows.To address this demand, we present a detailed error analysis of sub-meter resolution terrain models of two contiguous reaches (1.6 and 1.7. km long) of the braided Ahuriri River, New Zealand, generated using SfM. A six stage methodology is described, involving: i) hand-held image acquisition from an aerial platform, ii) 3d point cloud extraction modeling using Agisoft PhotoScan, iii) georeferencing on a redundant network of GPS-surveyed ground-control points, iv) point cloud filtering to reduce computational demand as well as reduce vegetation noise, v) optical bathymetric modeling of inundated areas; and vi) data fusion and surface modeling to generate sub-meter raster terrain models. Bootstrapped geo-registration as well as extensive distributed GPS and sonar-based bathymetric check-data were used to quantify the quality of the models generated after each processing step.The results obtained provide the first quantified analysis of SfM applied to model the complex terrain of a braided river. Results indicate that geo-registration errors of 0.04. m (planar) and 0.10. m (elevation) and vertical surface errors of 0.10. m in non-vegetation areas can be achieved from a dataset of photographs taken at 600. m and 800. m above the ground level. These encouraging results suggest that this low-cost, logistically simple method can deliver high quality terrain datasets competitive with those obtained with significantly more expensive laser scanning, and suitable for geomorphic change detection and hydrodynamic modeling. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Specifically, we propose a dataset containing 80 scenes of large variability. Each scene consists of 49 or 64 accurate camera positions and reference structured light scans, all acquired by a 6-axis industrial robot. To apply this dataset we propose an extension of the evaluation protocol from the Middlebury evaluation, reflecting the more complex geometry of some of our scenes. The proposed dataset is used to evaluate the state of the art multiview stereo algorithms of Tola et al., Campbell et al. and Furukawa et al. Hereby we demonstrate the usability of the dataset as well as gain insight into the workings and challenges of multi-view stereopsis. Through these experiments we empirically validate some of the central hypotheses of multi-view stereopsis, as well as determining and reaffirming some of the central challenges.},

abstract = {The use of terrestrial remote imaging techniques, specifically LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) and digital stereo-photogrammetry, are widely proven and accepted for the mapping of geological structure and monitoring of mass movements. The use of such technologies can be limited, however: LiDAR generally by the cost of acquisition, and stereo-photogrammetry by the tradeoff between possible resolution within the scene versus the spatial extent of the coverage. The objective of this research is to test a hybrid gigapixel photogrammetry method, and investigate optimal equipment configurations for use in mountainous terrain. The scope of the work included field testing at variable ranges, angles, resolutions, and in variable geological and climatologically settings. Original field work was carried out in Canada to test various lenses and cameras, and detailed field mapping excursions were conducted in Norway. The key findings of the research are example data generated by gigapixel photogrammetry, a detailed discussion on optimal photography equipment for gigapixel imaging, and implementations of the imaging possibilities for rockfall mapping. This paper represents a discussion about a new terrestrial 3-dimensional imaging technique. The findings of this research will directly benefit natural hazard mapping programs in which rockfall potential must be recorded and the use of standard 3-dimensional imaging techniques cannot be applied.

abstract = {The recent emergence of building information modeling (BIM) and the evolution of virtual design and construction (VDC) in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry are fundamentally changing the process by which buildings are designed and constructed. However, the perceived high initial cost of implementing BIM has deterred many industry professionals from adopting this technology. This paper aims to facilitate the decision-making process in the adoption of BIM by presenting the cost savings associated with implementing BIM. In many cases, an owner's willingness to pay for the BIM is crucial in the contractor's decision to use BIM. Therefore, in order to show the returns on the investment (ROI) of paying additional fees, data was gathered from three case studies on three sets of similar projects, with each set consisting of one recently constructed BIM-assisted project and one earlier, similar project completed without BIM. The potential savings to an owner choosing to invest in BIM as an additional service were estimated based on the measurable cost benefits associated with reduced schedule overruns, fewer requests for information (RFIs), and reduced change orders. This research confirmed that BIM is a worthwhile investment in the context of the company studied. In the three case studies presented, the ROI of BIM varied greatly from 16 to 1,654{\%}. Additionally, the total number of RFIs was reduced by 34{\%} on a small tilt-wall project, 68{\%} on a three-story assisted living facility, and 43{\%} on a midrise commercial condominium project, and the number of change orders was reduced by 40, 48, and 37{\%}, respectively. Though an owner's decision to invest in BIM should be weighed against the scale and complexity of a project, this research suggests that savings may be realized regardless of the size of a construction project. The paper presents a systematic approach for estimating the ROI realized in adopting BIM using standard project documentation. Finally, general suggestions for documenting BIM-assisted construction projects are outlined based on limitations uncovered during this study. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {The upstream migration of adult anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River Basin (CRB) has been dramatically altered and fish may be experiencing energetically costly delays at dams. To explore this notion, we estimated the energetic costs of migration and reproduction of Yakima River-bound spring Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha using a sequential analysis of their proximate composition (i.e., percent water, fat, protein, and ash). Tissues (muscle, viscera, and gonad) were sampled from fish near the start of their migration (Bonneville Dam), at a mid point (Roza Dam, 510km upstream from Bonneville Dam) and from fresh carcasses on the spawning grounds (about 100km above Roza Dam). At Bonneville Dam, the energy reserves of these fish were remarkably high, primarily due to the high percentage of fat in the muscle (18–20{\%}; energy content over 11 kJ g?1). The median travel time for fish from Bonneville to Roza Dam was 27 d and ranged from 18 to 42 d. Fish lost from 6 to 17{\%} of their energy density in muscle, depending on travel time. On average, fish taking a relatively long time for migration between dams used from 5 to 8{\%}more energy from the muscle than faster fish. From the time they passed Bonneville Damto death, these fish, depending on gender, used 95–99{\%} of their muscle and 73–86{\%} of their visceral lipid stores. Also, both sexes used about 32{\%} of their muscular and very little of their visceral protein stores. However, we were unable to relate energy use and reproductive success to migration history. Our results suggest a possible influence of the CRB hydroelectric system on adult salmonid energetics},

A multi-rotor UAV was used to obtain images using a vertically mounted digital camera. The flight was processed taking into account the photogrammetry workflow: perform the aerial triangulation, generate a digital surface model, orthorectify individual images and finally obtain a mosaic image or final orthophoto. The UAV orthophotos were assessed with various spatial quality tests used by national mapping agencies (NMAs). Results showed that the orthophotos satisfactorily passed the spatial quality tests and are therefore a useful tool for NMAs in their production flowchart.},

abstract = {We test the acquisition of high-resolution topographic and terrain data using hand-held smartphone technology, where the acquired images can be processed using technology freely available to the research community. This is achieved by evaluating the quality of digital terrain models (DTM) of a river bank and an Alpine alluvial fan generated with a fully automated, free-to-use, structure-from-motion package and a smartphone integrated camera (5 megapixels) with terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data used to provide a benchmark. To evaluate this approach a 16.2-megapixel digital camera and an established, commercial, close-range and semi-automated software are also employed, and the product of the four combinations of the two types of cameras and software are compared. Results for the river bank survey demonstrate that centimetre-precision DTMs can be achieved at close range (10 m or less), using a smartphone camera and a fully automated package. Results improve to sub-centimetre precision with either higher-resolution images or by applying specific post-processing techniques to the smartphone DTMs. Application to an entire Alpine alluvial fan system shows the degradation of precision scales linearly with image scale, but that (i) the expected level of precision remains and (ii) difficulties in separating vegetation and sediment cover within the results are similar to those typically found when using other photo-based techniques and laser scanning systems.

abstract = {Topographic data measurement is a fundamental aspect of many geomorphic research applications, particularly those including landform monitoring and investigation of changes in topography. However, most surveying techniques require relatively expensive technologies or specialized user supervision. Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetric technology reduces both these constraints by allowing the use of consumer grade digital cameras and highly automated data processing, which can be free to use. SfM photogrammetry therefore offers the possibility of fast, automated and low-cost acquisition of 3-D data, which has inevitably created great interest amongst the geomorphological community. In this contribution, the basic concepts of SfM photogrammetry are presented, whilst recognising its heritage. A few examples are employed to illustrate the potential of SfM applications for geomorphological research. In particular, SfM photogrammetry offers to geomorphologists a tool for high-resolution characterisation of 3-D forms at a range of scales and for change detection purposes. The high level of automation of SfM data processing creates both opportunities and threats, particularly because user control tends to focus upon visualisation of the final product rather than upon inherent data quality. Accordingly, this contribution seeks to guide potential new users in successfully applying SfM for a range of geomorphic studies. ISSN 2047-0371},

abstract = {The use of Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) data for deformation measurement is gaining increasing interest. This paper is focused on a new procedure for land deformation monitoring based on repeated TLS scans. The kernel of the procedure is the least squares 3D surface matching proposed by Gruen and Akca [Gruen, A., Akca, D., 2005. Least squares 3D surface and curve matching. ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing 59 (3), 151-174]. This paper describes the three main steps of the procedure, namely the acquisition of the TLS data, the global co-registration of the point clouds, and the estimation of the deformation parameters using local surface matchings. The paper briefly outlines the key advantages of the proposed approach, such as the capability to exploit the available high data redundancy using advanced analysis tools, the flexibility of the proposed solution, and the capability of providing fully 3D deformation measurements, including displacement vectors and rotations. Furthermore, it illustrates the performance of the proposed procedure with a validation experiment where a deformation measurement scenario was simulated and TLS and topographic data were acquired. From the analysis of this experiment, interesting features are highlighted: the validation errors below 1??cm in the displacements and below 1??gon in the rotations of small targets measured at a distance of 134??m; the increase by factor two of the errors when the same scene is measured from a distance of 225??m; and the importance of an accurate global co-registration in order to avoid systematic errors in the estimated deformation parameters. It is interesting to note that the above results were achieved under non-optimal conditions, e.g. using non-calibrated data and sub-optimal targets from the matching viewpoint. Besides the simulation experiment, the validation results achieved on landslide test site are briefly discussed. ?? 2007 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).},

abstract = {Experience with both analog and digital systems show that laboratory calibration is not necessarily valid in airborne conditions; whereas the advantages of field calibration are that the entire imaging system is calibrated and not alone the optical part; and the parameters determined are valid in operational airborne conditions (Cramer 2004, 2006 ; Honkavaara et al. International Archives of Photogrammetry", Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences 36, 2008a, b). The result of calibration and testing is dependent on a number of permanent system factors and systematic and random components associated with camera, imaging system, flight, atmosphere, object and data post-processing (Honkavaara et al. International Archives of Photogrammetry", Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences 36, 2008a, b) those affect the quality of the raw images produced by the sensors. It is therefore important to calibrate the aerial or satellite imaging sensors in specially designed fields so that the performance of the entire chain is assessed taking into consideration all the influencing factors. In addition to imaging sensors, ISO 19159 for 'Calibration and validation of remote sensing imagery sensors and data' also incorporates airborne laser scanners, imaging radar and water borne sonar systems (Kresse 2010). The task of developing uniform practices and standards for field calibration and testing has been taken up by several international working groups but hardly any permanent multipurpose test field like the one in Sj{\"{o}}kulla, Finland with facilities for radiometric and spatial resolution calibration and networks of targeted benchmarks for geometric calibration at large, medium and small imaging scales is available.

With this objective a multi-sensor calibration field, first of its kind in India, designed with targets for geometric calibration, radiometric calibration, spatial resolution and height accuracy calibration is under construction in Shadnagar about 50 km away from Hyderabad that would serve aerial sensors and very high resolution satellite sensors better than 1 m. {\textcopyright} 2014 Indian Society of Remote Sensing.},

abstract = {Data collection under highly variable weather and illumination conditions around the year will be necessary in many applications of UAV imaging systems. This is a new feature in rigorous photogrammetric and remote sensing processing. We studied performance of two georeferencing and point cloud generation approaches using image data sets collected in four seasons (winter, spring, summer and autumn) and under different imaging conditions (sunny, cloudy, different solar elevations). We used light, quadrocopter UAVs equipped with consumer cameras. In general, matching of image blocks collected with high overlaps provided high quality point clouds. All of the before mentioned factors influenced the point cloud quality. In winter time, the point cloud generation failed on uniform snow surfaces in many situations, and during leaf-off season the point cloud generation was not successful over deciduous trees. The images collected under cloudy conditions provided better point clouds than the images collected in sunny weather in shadowed regions and of tree surfaces. On homogeneous surfaces (e.g. asphalt) the images collected under sunny conditions outperformed cloudy data. The tested factors did not influence the general block adjustment results. The radiometric sensor performance (especially signal-to-noise ratio) is a critical factor in all weather data collection and point cloud generation; at the moment, high quality, light weight imaging sensors are still largely missing; sensitivity to wind is another potential limitation. There lies a great potential in low flying, low cost UAVs especially in applications requiring rapid aerial imaging for frequent monitoring.},

abstract = {The objective of this investigation was to develop and investigate methods for point cloud generation by image matching using aerial image data collected by quadrocopter type micro unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imaging systems. Automatic generation of high-quality, dense point clouds from digital images by image matching is a recent, cutting-edge step forward in digital photogrammetric technology. The major components of the system for point cloud generation are a UAV imaging system, an image data collection process using high image overlaps, and post-processing with image orientation and point cloud generation. Two post-processing approaches were developed: one of the methods is based on Bae Systems' SOCET SET classical commercial photogrammetric software and another is built using Microsoft({\textregistered})'s Photosynth™ service available in the Internet. Empirical testing was carried out in two test areas. Photosynth processing showed that it is possible to orient the images and generate point clouds fully automatically without any a priori orientation information or interactive work. The photogrammetric processing line provided dense and accurate point clouds that followed the theoretical principles of photogrammetry, but also some artifacts were detected. The point clouds from the Photosynth processing were sparser and noisier, which is to a large extent due to the fact that the method is not optimized for dense point cloud generation. Careful photogrammetric processing with self-calibration is required to achieve the highest accuracy. Our results demonstrate the high performance potential of the approach and that with rigorous processing it is possible to reach results that are consistent with theory. We also point out several further research topics. Based on theoretical and empirical results, we give recommendations for properties of imaging sensor, data collection and processing of UAV image data to ensure accurate point cloud generation.},

The number and variety of multi-camera oblique platforms available on the market is continuously growing. So far, few attempts have been made to study the influence of the additional cameras on the behaviour of the image block and comprehensive revisions to existing flight patterns are yet to be formulated. This paper looks into the precision and accuracy of 3D points triangulated from diverse multi-camera oblique platforms. Its coverage is divided into simulated and real case studies. Within the simulations, different imaging platform parameters and flight patterns are varied, reflecting both current market offerings and common flight practices. Attention is paid to the aspect of completeness in terms of dense matching algorithms and 3D city modelling - the most promising application of such systems. The experimental part demonstrates the behaviour of two oblique imaging platforms in real-world conditions. A number of Ground Control Point (GCP) configurations are adopted in order to point out the sensitivity of tested imaging networks and arising block deformations. To stress the contribution of slanted views, all scenarios are compared against a scenario in which exclusively nadir images are used for evaluation.},

Digital photogrammetry technology with Pix4D software application has been applied for UAV images processing and area mapping. High quality of images is a significant factor for the efficiency and accuracy generating standard mapping products. The correctness of digital surface models and orthophotos mainly depend on camera resolution, flight height and ground control point (GCP) accuracy. The paper reports on investigations how number of GCPs used for UAV image transformation influences the mapping results. The demand of such investigations arises because the flight paths with a fixed wing UAV have general form, in contrast to classical paths which are pricewise straight lines, as well as the flight significantly depends on weather conditions (especially on wind) and the platform shows considerable tilt because of its light weight. The results of DSM accuracy investigation demonstrate the quality of UAV Photogrammetry product with the use of appropriate number of GCPs.},

abstract = {Rough surfaces are ubiquitous in nature. Near-surface processes both encounter and create surface roughness. Recent advances in surveying have improved the resolution, extent and availability of topographic datasets. This broad review synthesises efforts to represent surface roughness in such datasets, drawing examples from a number of branches of Earth Science, with the aim of facilitating a more systematic exchange of roughness formulations. A number of issues surround the definition of roughness. The term 'roughness' has been applied variously to represent a property of a surface, a property of a flow and as a model tuning parameter; yet these distinctions are articulated rarely. There has been a proliferation of methods of quantifying surface roughness. Given the wide range of applications of roughness in the Earth Sciences, attempts to create a standardised parameter set will likely be problematic. Yet a standard protocol for reporting roughness calculation would be appropriate, especially considering the importance of the choice of partition scale in the distinction between roughness and topography. Applications of surface roughness treat it as a variable (in the mapping of landforms, for example), a surrogate for less measurable variables (as in the estimation of resistance to flows) or as an indicator of near-surface processes. Recent developments examining interactions between roughness elements (e.g. sheltering) highlight the need to consider the pattern of surface roughness (e.g. anisotropy, connectivity of peaks) if appropriate parameterisations are to be developed. Addressing these issues will maximise the exciting potential offered by advances in topographic surveys. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In the last decade advances in surveying technology have opened up the possibility of representing topography and monitoring surface changes over experimental plots ({\textless}10 m2) in high resolution ({\~{}}103 points m-1). Yet the representativeness of these small plots is limited. With ‘Structure-from-Motion' (SfM) and ‘Multi-View Stereo' (MVS) techniques now becoming part of the geomorphologist's toolkit, there is potential to expand further the scale at which we characterise topography and monitor geomorphic change morphometrically. Moving beyond previous plot-scale work using Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) surveys, this paper validates robustly a number of SfM-MVS surveys against total station and extensive TLS data at three nested scales: plots ({\textless}30 m2) within a small catchment (4710 m2) within an eroding marl badland landscape ({\~{}}1 km2). SfM surveys from a number of platforms are evaluated based on: (i) topography; (ii) sub-grid roughness; and (iii) change-detection capabilities at an annual scale. Oblique ground-based images can provide a high-quality surface equivalent to TLS at the plot scale, but become unreliable over larger areas of complex terrain. Degradation of surface quality with range is observed clearly for SfM models derived from aerial imagery. Recently modelled ‘doming' effects from the use of vertical imagery are proven empirically as a piloted gyrocopter survey at 50m altitude with convergent off-nadir imagery provided higher quality data than an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flying at the same height and collecting vertical imagery. For soil erosion monitoring, SfM can provide data comparable with TLS only from small survey ranges ({\~{}}5 m) and is best limited to survey ranges {\~{}}10–20 m. Synthesis of these results with existing validation studies shows a clear degradation of root-mean squared error (RMSE) with survey range, with a median ratio between RMSE and survey range of 1:639, and highlights the effect of the validation method (e.g. point-cloud or raster-based) on the estimated quality.

Two main issues have to be addressed in this context: (i) camera calibration (internal and external) and (ii) dense multi-view stereo. To investigate both, we have acquired test data from outdoor scenes both with LIDAR and cameras. Using the LIDAR data as reference we estimated the ground-truth for several scenes. Evaluation sets are prepared to evaluate different aspects of 3D model building. These are: (i) pose estimation and multi-view stereo with known internal camera parameters; (ii) camera calibration and multi-view stereo with the raw images as the only input and (iii) multi-view stereo.},

abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are an exciting new remote sensing tool capable of acquiring high resolution spatial data. Remote sensing with UAVs has the potential to provide imagery at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. The small footprint of UAV imagery, however, makes it necessary to develop automated techniques to geometrically rectify and mosaic the imagery such that larger areas can be monitored. In this paper, we present a technique for geometric correction and mosaicking of UAV photography using feature matching and Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetric techniques. Images are processed to create three dimensional point clouds, initially in an arbitrary model space. The point clouds are transformed into a real-world coordinate system using either a direct georeferencing technique that uses estimated camera positions or via a Ground Control Point (GCP) technique that uses automatically identified GCPs within the point cloud. The point cloud is then used to generate a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) required for rectification of the images. Subsequent georeferenced images are then joined together to form a mosaic of the study area. The absolute spatial accuracy of the direct technique was found to be 65–120 cm whilst the GCP technique achieves an accuracy of approximately 10–15 cm.},

abstract = {We investigate the problem of obtaining a dense reconstruction in real-time, from a live video stream. In recent years, multi-view stereo (MVS) has received considerable attention and a number of methods have been proposed. However, most methods operate under the assumption of a relatively sparse set of still images as input and unlimited computation time. Video based MVS has received less attention despite the fact that video sequences offer significant benefits in terms of usability of MVS systems. In this paper we propose a novel video based MVS algorithm that is suitable for real-time, interactive 3d modeling with a hand-held camera. The key idea is a per-pixel, probabilistic depth estimation scheme that updates posterior depth distributions with every new frame. The current implementation is capable of updating 15 million distributions/s. We evaluate the proposed method against the state-of-the-art real-time MVS method and show improvement in terms of accuracy. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Since the initial comparison of Seitz et al., the accuracy of dense multiview stereovision methods has been increasing steadily. A number of limitations, however, make most of these methods not suitable to outdoor scenes taken under uncontrolled imaging conditions. The present work consists of a complete dense multiview stereo pipeline which circumvents these limitations, being able to handle large-scale scenes without sacrificing accuracy. Highly detailed reconstructions are produced within very reasonable time thanks to two key stages in our pipeline: a minimum s-t cut optimization over an adaptive domain that robustly and efficiently filters a quasidense point cloud from outliers and reconstructs an initial surface by integrating visibility constraints, followed by a mesh-based variational refinement that captures small details, smartly handling photo-consistency, regularization, and adaptive resolution. The pipeline has been tested over a wide range of scenes: from classic compact objects taken in a laboratory setting, to outdoor architectural scenes, landscapes, and cultural heritage sites. The accuracy of its reconstructions has also been measured on the dense multiview benchmark proposed by Strecha et al., showing the results to compare more than favorably with the current state-of-the-art methods.},
