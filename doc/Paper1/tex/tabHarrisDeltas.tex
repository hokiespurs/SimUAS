  \caption{A checkerboard pattern is generated and then warped in Matlab before extracting the Harris Corner Features.  The difference between the known checkerboard corners and the Harris corner features are on the same order of magnitude as the differences in the rendered imagery simulation.  This suggests that the variance and mean offsets in the simulation are due to the uncertainty in the Harris Corner extraction, and not the renderer.}
